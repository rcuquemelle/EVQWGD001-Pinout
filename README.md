# EVQWGD001 Rotary Encoder Pinout

> [!NOTE]
> Most vendors provide an incorrect pinout and as a result a lot of examples and projects have it wrong. However, even if it's wired "wrong" it will still work fine, as most libraries are able to deal with the resulting signals. 

TL;DR, this is the correct pinout:
